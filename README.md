It is suggested that you go through all examples in the list before you can write your own plugin. Simply go through some of them, and then focus on those examples related to your needs.

## Motivation
When I first started looking at how to develop a Jenkins plugin, I spent quite some time on searching for useful education materials online. Despite the fact that there is ton of docs online that guide you on how to develop a Jenkins plugin, I often find that **playing with some basic examples of a new thing(plugin here)** can quickly bring you up to speed to work on it in a productive way. As a result, I didnt find any place providing such list of examples, and to embrace the spirit of open source, I am opening up this repo with some of the examples I used in learning developing Jenkins plugin. I hope that this will serve as a base for a complete list of basic examples that cover most Jenkins extension points. So, feel free to contribute any new basic example plugin that covers uncovered Jenkins extension points. Cheers!   - **[10000tb](https://github.com/10000TB)**
